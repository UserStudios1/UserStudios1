Unity Game Developing
--------------------

I've been coding for about 1-2 Years with C# and Unity. I developed a few prototypes but didnt really finished a Game.

C++ Developing

I've been coding with C++ for 1-2 Years now and did some basic Projects, like a Console Calculator or a simple ATM System.
I also did a Cheat for a Game called Assault Cube that changes your ammo.
